<h1>Hi! I am Marko Novaković 👨‍💻</h1>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/markon87/markon87/main/gh-header-full-banner.jpg" alt="Header Image" />
I'm a creative Frontend Engineer based in Bethesda, MD, passionate about crafting beautiful and responsive web solutions with engaging user-friendly experiences.</p>

<h2>What I Do</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Build modern ReactJS applications</strong> – I create fast, scalable, and maintainable web apps using React, often from the ground up.</li>
    <li><strong>Develop data-driven interfaces</strong> – I specialize in visualizing large datasets with intuitive and responsive UI components.</li>
    <li><strong>Integrate with RESTful APIs</strong> – I build frontend systems that communicate seamlessly with backend services to deliver real-time, dynamic content.</li>
    <li><strong>Create reusable component libraries</strong> – I design modular components that speed up development and maintain design consistency across projects.</li>
    <li><strong>Optimize for performance and accessibility</strong> – I follow best practices to ensure the apps I build are fast, accessible, and user-friendly across devices.</li>
    <li><strong>Collaborate across teams</strong> – I work closely with designers, backend engineers, and stakeholders to ship high-quality features on time.</li>
  </ul>

<h2>My Approach</h2>
<p>I believe that great frontend development is about more than writing code — it’s about creating thoughtful, scalable, and accessible user experiences that solve real problems.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>User-first mindset</strong> – I design interfaces that are intuitive, performant, and easy to navigate, especially when dealing with complex or large datasets.</li>
    <li><strong>Clean, maintainable code</strong> – I prioritize readability, reusability, and modular architecture to support long-term growth and collaboration.</li>
    <li><strong>End-to-end ownership</strong> – From design handoff to deployment, I take responsibility for the full lifecycle of features, ensuring quality and alignment with business goals.</li>
    <li><strong>Strong communication</strong> – I thrive in collaborative environments, working closely with designers, backend engineers, and stakeholders to bring ideas to life.</li>
    <li><strong>Continuous improvement</strong> – Whether it's learning new tools, refactoring code, or improving developer workflows, I’m always seeking ways to level up both the product and the process.</li>
  </ul>
